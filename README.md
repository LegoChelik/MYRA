If you, like me, don't like YouTube's new pink accent color, this script will help you bring back the simple red color to almost all elements.

To install this script you first need to install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net)
Now you can open main.user.js and click "Raw" or simply open [this link](https://github.com/LegoChelik/MYRA/raw/refs/heads/main/main.user.js). It will open a new tab and prompt you to install the script.
If your browser downloads .js file instead of script installation, simply copy the contents of main.user.js, create a new script in Tampermonkey and replace the template with previously copied text.

The subscription animation remained pink because I don't know how to recolor it. If you know how to do it, create a topic in Issues.
